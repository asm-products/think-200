This is the new development fork for Think 200; maintainted by the original author of the code. [Assembly has shut their doors](https://assembly.com/), and so I'm continuing development here.


## Cloud-based web service monitoring

The post, [Test Driven Devops](http://robb.weblaws.org/2014/01/16/new-open-source-library-for-test-driven-devops/), describes the custom RSpec matchers which underly this app. This repo is essentially a hosted platform for running RSpec.


### Development Setup

Vagrant-based development is set up:

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
3. copy `config/database.yml-default` to `config/database.yml`
4. copy `config/secrets.yml-default` to `config/secrets.yml`
5. Run the command `vagrant up`

Vagrant will download Ubuntu, set it up, and run the rspec tests. They should all pass. The first time you do this, it may take 5â€“10 minutes.

The VM can be logged in to with the `vagrant ssh` command. The VM mounts the source directory at `/vagrant` in standard Vagrant style. The VM's internal port 3000 is passed through to your host machine at 3000. This all means that you can edit the source and test with a web browser on your ("host") computer, while running ruby and rspec from within the VM.

So, to run the web app in development mode:

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd /vagrant
$ bundle exec rails s
```

See the `seeds.rb` file for the initial development users and data.

### Notes

This is a sample server json response to the queue-status request:

```json
{
  "percent_complete": 80,
  "projects": {
    "1": {
      "queued": "true",
      "tested_at": 1394765771
    },
    "2": {
      "queued": "false",
      "tested_at": 1394765781
    },
    "3": {
      "queued": "false",
      "tested_at": 1394765783
    },
    "4": {
      "queued": "false",
      "tested_at": 1394765784

    "5": {
      "queued": "false",
      "tested_at": 1394765785
